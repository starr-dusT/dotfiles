* References
Configuring Emacs can be an obsession. I have bounced back and forth between my from [[https://github.com/starr-dusT/scratch][scratch]] config and doom. In the end I find it hard to give up all the amazing work [[https://github.com/hlissner][hlissner]] has put into doom. Doom really simpifies the process of configuring Emacs with lots of pre-made bits and a nice framework for configuration. As much as it annoys me to not completelty control the config of the whole system I must comprimise to maintain my sanity. Find some useful references below:

- [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs Github]]
- [[https://github.com/zzamboni/dot-doom][zzamboni's nice config]]

* Doom config file overview

Doom Emacs uses three config files:

- =init.el= defines which of the existing Doom [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#modules][modules]] are loaded. A Doom module is a bundle of packages, configuration and commands, organized into a unit that can be toggled easily from this file.
- =packages.el= defines which [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#package-management][packages]] should be installed, beyond those that are installed and loaded as part of the enabled modules.
- =config.el= contains all [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#configuring-doom][custom configuration]] and code.

There are other files that can be loaded, but theses are the main ones. The load order of different files is [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#load-order][defined depending on the type of session]] being started.

All the config files are generated from this Org file, to try and make its meaning as clear as possible. All =package!= declarations are written to =packages.el=, all other LISP code is written to =config.el=.

** Config file headers

We start by simply defining the standard headers used by the three files. These headers come from the initial files generated by =doom install=, and contain either some Emacs-LISP relevant indicators like =lexical-binding=, or instructions about the contents of the file.

;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY
;; This is a file generated from a literate programing source file located at

;; You should make any changes there and regenerate it from Emacs org-mode
;; using org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t)

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load
;; in. Remember to run 'doom sync' after modifying it!

;; NOTE Press 'SPC h d h' (or 'C-h d h' for non-vim users) to access Doom's
;;      documentation. There you'll find a "Module Index" link where you'll find
;;      a comprehensive list of Doom's modules and what flags they support.

;; NOTE Move your cursor over a module's name (or its flags) and press 'K' (or
;;      'C-c c k' for non-vim users) to view its documentation. This works on
;;      flags as well (those symbols that start with a plus).
;;
;;      Alternatively, press 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') on a module to browse its
;;      directory (for easy access to its source code).

;; You should make any changes there and regenerate it from Emacs org-mode
;; using org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t)

;; To install a package with Doom you must declare them here and run 'doom sync'
;; on the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect -- or
;; use 'M-x doom/reload'.

;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
;;(package! some-package)

;; To install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
;; `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format
;;(package! another-package
;;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
;;(package! this-package
;;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

;; If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, you can do so here
;; with the `:disable' property:
;;(package! builtin-package :disable t)

;; You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
;; all the properties for `:recipe'. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
;; from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
;;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
;;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

;; Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
;; This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
;; our package manager can't deal with; see raxod502/straight.el#279)
;;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))

;; Use `:pin' to specify a particular commit to install.
;;(package! builtin-package :pin "1a2b3c4d5e")

;; Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
;; release. The `unpin!' macro allows you to unpin single packages...
;;(unpin! pinned-package)
;; ...or multiple packages
;;(unpin! pinned-package another-pinned-package)
;; ...Or *all* packages (NOT RECOMMENDED; will likely break things)
;;(unpin! t)

;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY
;; This is a file generated from a literate programing source file located at

;; You should make any changes there and regenerate it from Emacs org-mode
;; using org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t)

;; Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom
;; sync' after modifying this file!

;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets.
;; (setq user-full-name "John Doe"
;;      user-mail-address "john@doe.com")

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 13))

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
;; (setq doom-theme 'doom-one)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
;; (setq org-directory "~/org/")

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
;; (setq display-line-numbers-type t)

;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.

** Keybindings

Add all my additional keybinds to Doom's standard SPC lead keymapping system.

(map! :leader
      ; Add to the "open" menu in Doom

#+end_src

* Org mode
** Org directories

Define the folder structure for my gtd-esque setup. I don't declaritvely define every file within this folder stucture, but search for .org files within four primary folders: capture, agenda, todo, and note.

** Org-Roam

I'm attempting to use [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][Org-Roam]] to implement something of the Zettelkasten method. I know... I know it is the flavor of the month, but I've tried to develop my own notetaking methods and workflow and found myself paralyzed by choice. So I'll give this a try!

** Get Things Done (GTD)
*** Tasks

Define the org todo keywords we'll use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (member this-system all-systems) "config.el" "no")
(after! org
  (setq org-todo-keywords
        '((sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "CHASE(c)" "WIP(p)" "WAIT(w@/!)"
                    "GAVE(g@/!)" "|" "KILL(k@/!)" "DONE(d)")))
  ; TODO add (1)...(10) numbers for task ordering (replacing "next")
  (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
      (quote (("TODO"  :foreground "red"          :weight bold)
              ("CHASE" :foreground "red"          :weight bold)
              ("WIP"   :foreground "blue"         :weight bold)
              ("NEXT"  :foreground "orange"       :weight bold)
              ("GAVE"  :foreground "orange"       :weight bold)
              ("WAIT"  :foreground "orange"       :weight bold)
              ("KILL"  :foreground "forest green" :weight bold)
              ("DONE"  :foreground "forest green" :weight bold))))
#+end_src

*** Tags

Define the A tier tags.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (member this-system all-systems) "config.el" "no")
  (setq org-use-tag-inheritance t)
  (setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance '("prj" "prg" "subprj"))

*** Capture
**** Capture File Paths

Define the different files that are used for capture. Currently, I use inbox.org for TODO esque items and note.org for notes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (member this-system all-systems) "config.el" "no")
  (setq org-capture-todo (concat org-directory "gtd/capture/inbox.org"))
#+end_src

**** Capture Templates

Setup org-capture templates for nice capturing.

Allowable tags: @work, @home, note, question, habit

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (member this-system all-systems) "config.el" "no")
  (setq org-capture-templates
        (doct '(("todo" :keys "t"
                 :file org-capture-todo
                 :template ("* TODO %?" "%U"))
                ("question" :keys "q"
                 :file org-capture-todo
                 :template ("* TODO Find out %? :question:"
                            "%U"))
                ("habit" :keys "h"
                 :file org-capture-todo
                 :template ("* NEXT %? :habit:exclude:" "%U"
                            "SCHEDULED: %(format-time-string
                                         \"%<<%Y-%m-%d %a .+1d/3d>>\")"
                            ":PROPERTIES:" ":STYLE: habit"
                            ":REPEAT_TO_STATE: NEXT" ":END:"))
                ("meeting" :keys "m"
                 :file org-capture-todo
                 :template ("* NEXT %? :meeting:exclude:"
                            "%U")))))
#+end_src

*** Refile

Set various refile settings. Mostly stolen from the great http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (member this-system all-systems) "config.el" "no")
  (setq org-refile-targets (quote ((nil :maxlevel . 3)
                                   (org-agenda-files :maxlevel . 3))))
  (advice-add 'org-refile :after 'org-save-all-org-buffers)
#+end_src

*** Views
**** Agenda

Currenlty I prefer to used vanilla Org-Agenda to view currently scheduled agenda items without any fancy sorting or anything like that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (member this-system all-systems) "config.el" "no")
  (setq org-agenda-start-day "0d")
  (setq org-agenda-show-future-repeats 'next)

Following config items will utilizes the awesome [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql#function-org-ql-block][org-ql]] and [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda][super-org-agenda]] to setup custom views with fancy sorting and insights. More details to follow!
