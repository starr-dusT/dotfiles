# Hogwarts Legacy

Follow instructions from [here](https://www.protondb.com/app/990080). The following was used:

```
Tinker Steps:
Switch to experimental
Control Layout:
Switch To Official
Control Layout Customization:
Grip Buttons, Gyro
Battery Performance:
40 FPS Cap, Manual GPU 1300 hz

In game: Activate FSR 3 Quality and turn on Frame Generation. Unlimited FPS
I'm also using this mod: https://www.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/mods/1805
Steam Deck Performance Tab: have it capped at 40 fps, allow tearing, TDP disabled, Manual GPU at 1300 mhz
Using Proton Experimental (has the new proton 10, less latency)
In the Decky Loader:

Plugin Powertools, also created a game profile and changed the governor to performance
Plugin "LetMeReshade", I'm using this reshader for FSR sharpness, way better than the sharpness setting in game: Amd FidelityFX CAS
